# Assignment

Use this application skeleton to implement an exchange rates provider for our other services. The first version of the application will be implemented as a caching layer over a 3rd-party service.

https://github.com/shipmonk-rnd/exchange-rates-task-stub

We don't want you to spend days with this task, therefore if you'll have to decide between finishing all functionality or designing app architecture, give the architecture a priority. Nicely architected application, but not fully functional will get more points than badly architected but working app.

* Use https://fixer.io/ as exchange rates source
* Register a new account for development and testing on your personal email
* Base currency is USD
* Response shape of /api/v1/rates/{day} should be similar to what https://fixer.io/documentation responds
* Use PostgreSQL to store the cached exchange rates
* Start a local database for development using docker-compose up -d database
* You can use whatever libraries you may need
* If you have experience with Hibernate, please use it to demonstrate your knowledge
* The service will be used only internally, so securing the API is not needed
* Prioritize making the code testable, donâ€™t spend too much time writing tests for everything at the expense of other requirements. But if you want and have time for it, you can write a test or two.
* Think of edge cases that can occur in this environment and design solid error handling so that the downstream services can be simplified as much as reasonably possible.
* See test.sh for example requests


Please, don't push anything to the repo and don't fork it. Use your own GIT repo.
